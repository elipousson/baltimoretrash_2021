The goal of baltimoretrash_2021 is to explore service requests, ECB citations, and other related open data to present an area-level analysis of trash and environmental health conditions in Baltimore, Maryland. This project is developed by the [Neighborhood Design Center](https://ndc-md.org/) with support from the [University of Baltimore Data Science Corps program](https://bniajfi.org/currentprojects/data_science_corps/).

## Key Questions
### Help residents answer key questions about trash in their neighborhoods

1. Where are the worst issues with trash in the neighborhood?
2. Are issues with trash getting better or worse over time? (Low Priority)
3. How do issues with trash in the neighborhood compare to other nearby neighborhoods?
4. What types of issues with trash are taking place in the neighborhood? e.g. illegal dumping, trash in yards (aka trash accumulation)

### Help residents work with city agencies to effectively direct city services

1. Are there areas where there are fewer service requests or fewer citations or unpaid citations?
